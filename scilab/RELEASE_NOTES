Scilab 5.0 Alpha Release_Notes
******************************

- Some menus/buttons functionnalities are not yet available in GUIs. 
A click on them will display a dialog box.

- Uicontrols have been mapped to java objects. However some functionnalities
such as units property management are no yet available.

- Uicontrols ascendant incompatibilities:
        * Figure size has to be increased beacause of the automatic insertion of a menubar and the height of the docking bar.
        * Popup uicontrols width has to be increased because of the little triangle used to select a new value.

- Graphic functionalities are not yet fully functional:
	* xlcea
	* viewport management
	* show_pixmap
	* driver / xinit / xend
	* seteventhandler
	* info_message
	* Text object font management
	* Figure name property
	* Postscript formats for graphic export

- Graphics know bugs
	* Displayed axe bounds may differ from Scilab 4.x.a
	* Unwanted marks may appear.
	* Some colours might be different from Scilab 4.x.
	* Legend and labels might be misplaced.
	* Text object space management
	* Rendering is slow or not functional on some computer / graphic card / graphic card driver combination.
	  Errors often appear on ATI and Intel cards under Linux and also with old Nvidia drivers.

- It is strongly recommended to update graphic cards drivers to the latest revision:

- Scicos:
	* Some functionalites of the new graphics API are still not fully available/working at the moment
	  of this release (e.g. show_pixmap, VIEWPORT pan control, etc.)
	* Some mouse and key events are not detected (e.g. button release)
          - For these - and others - reasons, some feature of the Scicos editor are still non functional
	  - The Scicos simulation engine is correcly working (scicos_simulate)
        * BEWARE : the "Stop" simulation button is not working: set the simulation time to your final time
        * BEWARE : Modelica support is not available
          
- Scilab is not fully translated into French.

- Dynamic/incremental link may bug on usual archs/compiler or with modified flags



Scilab 4.0 Release_Notes
***************************

- Next to the on line help of the software, we advise you, to make
the first move with Scilab, to consult the Scilab step-to-step web site
(http://www.spas.cnrs-gif.fr/index.html).

- Please note that:
    - Scilab 4.x versions family will be the last versions working
with the old graphics mode.
    - Scilab v 4.0 is the last release working with Microsoft
Windows 98 and Microsoft Visual 6.0 (compilation, not incremental link)
supported by Scilab operational team.

- Scilab binary versions are built:
    - for Linux: gcc-3.4.3 and g77 compilers with a platform under
Mandriva 2005. No need to recompile except to use incremental link, we
advise indeed to download the source files if you are using others
compilers.
    - for Windows: Visual Studio .Net 2003 and Fortran and C Intel
compilers with a platform under Windows XP Service Pack 2 .
    - Recall: No Scilab GTK version is provided and supported by
the operational team. Same way about MinGW and Cygwin.
