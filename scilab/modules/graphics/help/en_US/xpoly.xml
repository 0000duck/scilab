  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P><VERB>xpoly</VERB> draws a single polyline described by the vectors of
    coordinates <VERB>xv</VERB> and <VERB>yv</VERB>. If <VERB>xv</VERB> and
    <VERB>yv</VERB> are matrices they are considered as vectors by
    concatenating their columns. <VERB>dtype</VERB> can be
    <VERB>"lines"</VERB> for using the current line style or
    <VERB>"marks"</VERB> for using the current mark to draw the polyline.</P>
  </DESCRIPTION>

xset("color",5)
xpoly(x,y,"lines",1) // by default closed

// News graphics only
e=gce(); // get the current entity (the last created: here the polyline)
e.closed = 'off' // the polyline is now open
