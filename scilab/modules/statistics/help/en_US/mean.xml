  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>For a vector or a matrix <VERB>x</VERB>, <VERB>y=mean(x)</VERB> returns
    in the scalar <VERB>y</VERB> the mean of all the entries of
    <VERB>x</VERB>.</P>

    <P><VERB>y=mean(x,'r')</VERB> (or, equivalently, <VERB>y=mean(x,1)</VERB>)
    is the rowwise mean. It returns a row vector: <VERB>y(j)=
    mean(x(:,j))</VERB></P>

    <P><VERB>y=mean(x,'c')</VERB> (or, equivalently, <VERB>y=mean(x,2)</VERB>)
    is the columnwise mean. It returns a column vector: <VERB>y(i)=
    mean(x(i,:))</VERB></P>

    <P><VERB>y=mean(x,'m')</VERB> is the mean along the first non singleton
    dimension of x (for compatibility with Matlab).</P>
  </DESCRIPTION>

// in this case mean(A,'m') is equivalent to mean(A,3), the first non singleton dimension of A
