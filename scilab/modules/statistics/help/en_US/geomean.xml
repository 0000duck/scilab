    <P>
    This  function computes the  geometric mean of a vector or
    matrix <VERB> x</VERB>.  For a  vector or matrix  <VERB> x</VERB>, 
    <VERB>gm=geomean(x) </VERB>   returns  in  scalar  <VERB>   gm</VERB> the
    geometric mean of all the entries of <VERB> x</VERB>.</P>
    <P><VERB>   gm=geomean(x,'r')    </VERB>   (or,   equivalently, 
    <VERB>gm=gmean(x,1)  </VERB>  )  returns in  each   entry of the row
    vector <VERB> gm</VERB> the geometric mean of each column of <VERB> x</VERB>.</P>
    <P><VERB>   gm=geomean(x,'c')    </VERB>  (or,    equivalently,  
    <VERB>gm=gmean(x,2) </VERB>  ) returns in each  entry  of the column
    vector <VERB> gm</VERB> the geometric mean of  each row of <VERB> x </VERB>.</P>
