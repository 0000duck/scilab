  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="hypermatrices"> Scilab object, N dimensional matrices in Scilab</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>
  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
    Hypermatrix type allows to manipulate multidimensional arrays</P>
    <P>
    They can be defined by extension of 2D matrices as follows
    a=[1 2;3 4];a(:,:,2)=rand(2,2)</P>
    <P>
    or directly using <VERB>hypermat</VERB> function</P>
    <P>
    Entries  can be real or complex numbers, polynomials,
    rationals, strings, booleans.</P>
    <P>
    Hypermatrices are <VERB>mlists</VERB>:
    <VERB>mlist(['hm','dims','entries'],sz,v)</VERB> where <VERB>sz</VERB> is the row
    vector of dimensions and <VERB>v</VERB> the column vector of entries (first
      dimension are stored first)</P>

     <P>NOTES: The number of dimension of hypermatrices with right-most sizes equal to
      1 are automatically reduced. An hypermatrix with only two dimensions is
      automatically changed to a regular matrix (type 1).</P>
  </DESCRIPTION>
  <EXAMPLE>
<![CDATA[
a(1,1,1,1:2)=[1 2]
a=[1 2;3 4];a(:,:,2)=rand(2,2)
a(1,1,:)

size(a)

a(:,:,1) //dimensionnality reduction
type(a(:,:,1))
