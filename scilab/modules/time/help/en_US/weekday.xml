		<P>[N,S] = weekday(D, form) returns the week in numeric(N) and string(S) form, where the content of S depends on the form argument. If form is 'long', then S countains the full name of the weekday (e.g, Thuesday). If form is 'short', then S contains an abbreviated name (e.g., Tue) from this table.</P>
