  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
    evaluates the polynomial or rational
    matrix <VERB>P = P(s)</VERB> when the variable <VERB>s</VERB> of the
    polynomial is replaced by <VERB>x</VERB>:</P>
    <P><VERB>horner(P,x)</VERB>=<VERB>P(x)</VERB></P>
    <P>
    Example (Bilinear transform): Assume <VERB>P = P(s)</VERB> is
    a rational matrix  then the rational matrix
    <VERB>P((1+s)/(1-s))</VERB> is obtained by <VERB>horner(P,(1+s)/(1-s))</VERB>.</P>
    <P>
    To evaluate a rational matrix at given frequencies use
    preferably the <VERB>freq</VERB> primitive.</P>
