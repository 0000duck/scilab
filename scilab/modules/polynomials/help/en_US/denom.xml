  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P><VERB>den=denom(r)</VERB> returns the denominator of a rational matrix.</P>
    <P>
    Since rationals are internally represented as
    <VERB>r=list(['r','num','den','dt'],num,den,[])</VERB>,
    <VERB>denom(r</VERB>) is the same as <VERB>r(3)</VERB>,
    <VERB>r('den')</VERB> or <VERB>r.den</VERB></P>
