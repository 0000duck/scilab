                      ----------------------

 Linux Library for the PMD  devices
 -------------------------------------

Currently Supporting:
--------------------
1. PMD1208LS
2. PMD1024LS
3. PMD1024HLS
4. PMD1208FS
5. PMD1608FS

Introduction:
-------------

This driver was written by Warren J. Jasper at North Carolina State
University with help from Melih Gunay and Mike Erickson
(mikee@signalscape.com) It is a library API for the PMD family of
devices from Measurement Computing.

Please send comments and bug fixes to wjasper@tx.ncsu.edu.  The source
for the driver is located at ftp://lx10.tx.ncsu.edu/pub/Linux/drivers.

CURRENTLY, THIS CODE WILL ONLY WORK ON THE 2.6 LINUX KERNEL.  HID is
not correctly implemented under 2.4.X and will not interface with the
PMD devices.

NOTE: This API uses the Linux HID driver.  Currently, the HID driver
does not support block transfers of report usages correctly, and has
severe performance issues, especially compared to the Windows HID driver.
I welcome any and all feedback on how to imporove the reliability and
the performance of these drivers.

Building and installing the driver:
-----------------------------------

1. Untar the tar file:
   tar zxvf PMD.1.2.tgz

2. This should create the following files:
    README
    Makefile
    License
    test-pmd1208LS.c
    test-pmd1024LS.c
    test-pmd1208FS.c
    test-pmd1608FS.c
    pmd-1208LS.c
    pmd-1208LS.h
    pmd-1208FS.c
    pmd-1208FS.h
    pmd-1608FS.c
    pmd-1608FS.h
    pmd-1024LS.c
    pmd-1024LS.h
    pmd.c
    pmd.h

3. To make the library type:
     make
   To make a static version
     make static

4. To install the library
     make install

Note:
-----
Your kernel needs to be configured with /dev/usb/hiddev support.
Right now, only woks on the 2.6.X kernels.

If the device nodes are not located in /dev/usb/hiddev*, the please
edit the code accordingly.
