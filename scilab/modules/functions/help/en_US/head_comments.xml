		<P>
			<VERB>comments(name)</VERB> displays the function header comments (like the
			Matlab help). The comments are read from the associated sci-file. If <VERB>name</VERB>
			if a function in a library the sci-file path is those given by the library
			path (see <VERB>lib</VERB>). If <VERB>name</VERB> if a function which is
			not in a library, a file with name <VERB>name.sci</VERB> is searched in the
			directories given by the variable <VERB>%paths</VERB>
		</P>
		<P>
			Warning, most of the scilab predefined functions have no header comments.
