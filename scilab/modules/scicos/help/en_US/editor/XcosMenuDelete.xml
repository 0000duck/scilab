    <para>
      To delete editors objects ( blocks links or texts), select the
      desired objects then activate this menu.  It is also possible to
      first activate the menu and then to select the object to be
      deleted.
    </para>
      When a block is deleted all the connected links are also
      deleted. In a similar way when a link is deleted all the links
      issued from this links are also deleted. This mechanism insure
      that no unconnected links may exist.

   <para> 
       The [Delete] or [Backspace] as well as the [d] key are
       equivalent of the <literal>Delete</literal> menu.
