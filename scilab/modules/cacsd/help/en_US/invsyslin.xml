  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
    Utility function. Computes the state form of the inverse <VERB>sl2</VERB> of 
    the linear system <VERB>sl1</VERB> (which is also given in state form).</P>
    <P>
    The <VERB>D</VERB>-matrix is supposed to be full rank. Old stuff used by 
    <VERB>inv(S)</VERB> when <VERB>S</VERB> is a <VERB>syslin</VERB> list.</P>
