  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
    Inner-outer factorization (and row compression) of (<VERB>l</VERB>x<VERB>p</VERB>) <VERB>G =[A,B,C,D]</VERB> with <VERB>l&gt;=p</VERB>.</P>
    <P><VERB>G</VERB> is assumed to be tall (<VERB>l&gt;=p</VERB>) without zero on the imaginary axis
    and with a <VERB>D</VERB> matrix which is full column rank.</P>
    <P><VERB>G</VERB> must also be stable for having <VERB>Gbar</VERB> stable.</P>
    <P><VERB>G</VERB> admits the following inner-outer factorization:</P>
    <VERBATIM>
<![CDATA[
         G = [ Inn ] | Gbar |
                     |  0   |
   ]]>
    </VERBATIM>
    <P>
    where <VERB>Inn</VERB> is square and inner (all pass and stable) and <VERB>Gbar</VERB> 
    square and outer i.e:
    Gbar is square bi-proper and bi-stable (Gbar inverse is also proper 
    and stable);</P>
    <P>
    Note that:</P>
    <VERBATIM>
<![CDATA[
         [ Gbar ]
   X*G = [  -   ]
         [  0   ]
   ]]>
    </VERBATIM>
    <P>
    is a row compression of <VERB>G</VERB> where <VERB>X</VERB> = <VERB>Inn</VERB> inverse is all-pass i.e:</P>
    <VERBATIM>
<![CDATA[
 T
X (-s) X(s) = Identity
   ]]>
    </VERBATIM>
    <P>
    (for the continous time case).</P>
