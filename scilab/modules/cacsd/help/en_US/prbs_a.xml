  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
    generation of pseudo random binary sequences
    <VERB>u=[u0,u1,...,u_(n-1)]</VERB>
    u takes values in {-1,1} and changes at most nc times its sign.
    ids can be used to fix the date at which u must change its sign 
    ids is then an integer vector with values in <VERB>[1:n]</VERB>.</P>
  </DESCRIPTION>
  <EXAMPLE>
<![CDATA[
u=prbs_a(50,10);
plot2d2("onn",(1:50)',u',1,"151",' ',[0,-1.5,50,1.5]);
