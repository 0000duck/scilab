  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
    Exponentiation of matrices or vectors by a constant vector.</P>
    <P>
    If <VERB>A</VERB> is a vector or a rectangular matrix the exponentiation is done
    element-wise, with the usual meaning.</P>
    <P>
    For square <VERB>A</VERB> matrices the exponentiation is done in the matrix sense.</P>
    <P>
    For boolean, polynomial and rational matrices, the exponent must be an
    integer</P>
    <P>
    Remark that <VERB>123.^b</VERB> is interpreted as <VERB>(123).^b</VERB>. In such
    cases dot is part of the operator, not of the number.</P>
