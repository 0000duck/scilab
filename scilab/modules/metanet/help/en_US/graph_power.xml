  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P><VERB>graph_power</VERB> computes the directed graph <VERB>g1</VERB> which is the kth power 
    of directed 1-graph <VERB>g</VERB>.
    There is an arc between two nodes in <VERB>g1</VERB> if there exists a path between 
    these nodes of length at most k in <VERB>g</VERB>.
    <VERB>graph_power(g,1)</VERB> is graph <VERB>g</VERB>.</P>
    <P>
    If such a graph does not exist, an empty vector is returned.</P>
