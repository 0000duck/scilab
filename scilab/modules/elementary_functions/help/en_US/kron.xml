  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
    <VERB>kron(A,B)</VERB> or  <VERB>A.*.B</VERB> returns the Kronecker tensor 
    product of two matrices <VERB>A</VERB> and <VERB>B</VERB>. The resulting
    matrix has the following block form:
    </P>
    <VERBATIM><![CDATA[
              | A(1,1) B ..... A(1,n) B |
              |   .              .      |
    A .*. B = |   .              .      |   
              |   .              .      |
              | A(m,1) B ..... A(m,n) B |
    ]]></VERBATIM>
    <P> If <VERB>A</VERB> is a  <VERB>m x n</VERB> matrix and  <VERB>B</VERB> a  
       <VERB>p x q</VERB> matrix then <VERB>A.*.B</VERB> is a  
       <VERB>(m*p) x (n*q)</VERB> matrix.
    </P>
    <P><VERB>A</VERB> and <VERB>B</VERB> can be sparse matrices.</P>
