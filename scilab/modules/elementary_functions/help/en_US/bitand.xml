  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>Given <VERB>x</VERB> and <VERB>y</VERB> two positives integers, this
    function returns <VERB>z</VERB> the decimal number whose the binary form
    is the AND of the binary representations of <VERB>x</VERB> and
    <VERB>y</VERB>. (<VERB>x</VERB>, <VERB>y</VERB>, <VERB>z</VERB> have the
    same size. If dimension of <VERB>x</VERB> (and <VERB>y</VERB>) is superior
    than 1 then <VERB>z(i)</VERB> is equal to
    <VERB>bitand(x(i),y(i))</VERB></P>
  </DESCRIPTION>

  <EXAMPLE><![CDATA[// example 1 :
// '1010110' : is the binary representation of 86 
// '1011011' : is the binary representation of 91   
// '1010010' : is the binary representation for the AND of binary representation 86 and 91 
// so the decimal number corresponding to the AND  applied to binary forms 86 and 91 is : 82
x=86; y=91
z=bitand(x,y)


// example 2 :
x=[12,45],y=[25,49]
z=bitand(x,y)
