  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>Linearly spaced vector. <VERB>linspace(x1, x2)</VERB> generates a row
    vector of n (default value=100) linearly equally spaced points between
    <VERB>x1</VERB> and <VERB>x2</VERB>. If <VERB>x1</VERB> or <VERB>x2</VERB>
    are complex then <VERB>linspace(x1,x2)</VERB> returns a row vector of n
    complexes, the real (resp. imaginary) parts of the n complexes are
    linearly equally spaced between the real (resp. imaginary) parst of
    <VERB>x1</VERB> and <VERB>x2</VERB></P>
