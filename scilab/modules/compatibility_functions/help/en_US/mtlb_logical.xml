  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_logical">Matlab logical emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>There is no Scilab equivalent function for Matlab <VERB>logical</VERB> but its behavior can be easyly reproduced.</P>
    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_logical(A)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>logical(A)</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what was the input while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_logical</VERB> calls:
    </P>
