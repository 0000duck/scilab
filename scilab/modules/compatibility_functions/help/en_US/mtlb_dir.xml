  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_dir">Matlab dir emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab and Scilab <VERB>dir</VERB> behave differently:</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        When result is stored in a variable: Matlab <VERB>dir</VERB> returns a structure but Scilab
	<VERB>dir</VERB> returns a 'dir' tlist, so data can not be extracted in the same way.
        </SP>
      </ITEM>
    </ITEMIZE>
    </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_dir([path])</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>dir([path])</VERB> when output is stored in a variable.
    There is no replacement possibility for it, else (when <VERB>mtlb_dir</VERB> is replaced by <VERB>dir</VERB>)
    data can not be extracted like in Matlab. For example, Scilab equivalent for Matlab
    <VERB>L=dir;file_name=L(1).name;</VERB> is <VERB>L=dir();file_name=L.name(1);</VERB>.
    </P>

    <P>Caution: <VERB>mtlb_dir</VERB> has not to be used for hand coded functions.</P>
