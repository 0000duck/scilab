  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_ifft">Matlab ifft emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab <VERB>ifft</VERB> and Scilab <VERB>fft</VERB> behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        With one input parameter: If input is a scalar or vector Scilab equivalent for Matlab <VERB>ifft(A)</VERB>
	is <VERB>fft(A,1)</VERB> else if input is a matrix Scilab equivalent for Matlab <VERB>fft</VERB>
	is <VERB>fft(A,1,2,1)</VERB>
        </SP>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_ifft(X[,n,[job]])</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>ifft(X[,n,[job]])</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_ifft</VERB> calls:
