  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_upper">Matlab upper emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab <VERB>upper(A)</VERB> and Scilab <VERB>convstr(A,&quot;u&quot;)</VERB> behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        If <VERB>A</VERB> is not a chacarter string matrix: Matlab <VERB>upper</VERB> can be used with a
	not-character-string <VERB>A</VERB> but not Scilab <VERB>convstr</VERB>.
        </SP>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_upper(A)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>upper(A)</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_upper</VERB> calls:
