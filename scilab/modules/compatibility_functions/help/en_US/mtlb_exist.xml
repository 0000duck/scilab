  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_exist">Matlab exist emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>There is no Scilab equivalent for Matlab <VERB>exist</VERB> except when input is a variable.
    Scilab <VERB>mtlb_exist</VERB> is a partial emulation of of this function.</P>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>r = mtlb_exist(nam[,tp])</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>exist(nam[,tp])</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_exist</VERB> calls:
    </P>

        <SP>
        When called with one input and if <VERB>nam</VERB> is a variable name,
        <VERB>mtlb_exist(nam)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>exists(nam)</VERB>
