  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_beta">Matlab beta emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab and Scilab <VERB>beta</VERB> behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        With inputs having different sizes: Matlab <VERB>beta</VERB> input parameters must have
	the same size unless one of them is a scalar. In Scilab <VERB>beta</VERB> input parameters
	must have the same size even if one of them is a scalar.

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_beta(A,B)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>beta(A,B)</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_beta</VERB> calls:

        <VERB>Y = mtlb_beta(A,B)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>C=B;C(:)=A;Y = mtlb_beta(C,B);</VERB>
