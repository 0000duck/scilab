  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_0">Matlab non-conjugate transposition emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab and Scilab non-conjugate transposition behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	With character strings operands: The <VERB>.'</VERB> operator is used to transpose whole 
	character strings in Scilab while Matlab realizes the transposition of each character.
	</SP>
      </ITEM>
    </ITEMIZE>
    </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
   
    <P>  
    The function <VERB>mtlb_0(A)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>A.'</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the operands while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_0</VERB> calls:
    </P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	If <VERB>A</VERB> is not a character string matrix
	<VERB>mtlb_0(A)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>A.'</VERB>
 	</SP>
      </ITEM>
    </ITEMIZE>
    </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>

    <P>Caution: <VERB>mtlb_0</VERB> has not to be used for hand coded functions.</P>
