  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_full">Matlab full emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab and Scilab <VERB>full</VERB> behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        With character strings input: Matlab <VERB>full</VERB> can be used with character string input
	while Scilab function cannot.
        </SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        With boolean input: Matlab <VERB>full</VERB> can be used with boolean input
	while Scilab function cannot.

    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_full(A)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>full(A)</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what was the input while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_full</VERB> calls:
    </P>

        <SP>
        If <VERB>A</VERB> is a double matrix
        <VERB>mtlb_full(A)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>full(A)</VERB>
        </SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        If <VERB>A</VERB> is a boolean matrix
        <VERB>mtlb_full(A)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>full(bool2s(A))</VERB>

    <P>Caution: <VERB>mtlb_full</VERB> has not to be used for hand coded functions.</P>
