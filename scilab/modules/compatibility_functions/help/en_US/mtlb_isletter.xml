  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_isletter">Matlab isletter emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>There is no Scilab equivalent function for Matlab <VERB>isletter</VERB> and equivalent instructions are quite ugly, so 
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> uses <VERB>mtlb_isletter(A)</VERB> to replace <VERB>isletter(A)</VERB>. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_isletter</VERB> calls:
