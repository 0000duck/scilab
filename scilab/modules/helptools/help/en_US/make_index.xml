  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
    The on-line help reads first the <VERB>index.html</VERB> file
    which contains the list of the chapters. This file comes with Scilab and is
    in the directory <VERB>SCIDIR/man/&lt;language&gt;</VERB> (see
    <LINK>man</LINK>). It is possible to change this
    index file while interactively adding new chapters. For that,
    modify the <LINK>%helps</LINK> variable and then use the
    <VERB>make_index</VERB> function.</P>
