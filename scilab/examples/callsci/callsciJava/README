	How to make calls to Scilab interpreter 
	from a Java program using JNI 
	(Java Native interface: 
		http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/jni/index.html)
	(Unix only since the proper Makefiles for windows 
	are not still writen) 

In this directory we provide a small example of a java class 
which use the Scilab interpreter to perform matrix computation 

This example was only tested under linux: Red Hat Fedora 1 Linux and 

Important Note: This demo will not work with a binary scilab 
	version. You need to have a locally compiled scilab version 
	(I need some .o files) 

To make it run you have to: 

 1) Edit the Makefile 
    change the SCIDIR variable to fit your local Scilab installation 
    change JAVAINC to the proper jav include directory /usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_03/include
   (on my local installation it was 
   -I/usr/local/jdk1.3/include -I/usr/local/jdk1.3/include/linux ) 

    On some Linux distributions you will have to add fix.c 
    in the Makefile (it is here by default) 
    see file bug.txt 

 3) Edit javasci/Makefile if you want to change the classpath 
    Edit example/Makefile if you want to change the classpath 

Then type 
	make distclean 
	make all 
	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH `pwd`

	and run the test files 

	java TestMatrix1 
	java TestMatrix2
	java TestMatrix3
	java TestMatrix4
	java TestMatrix

That's all
