	How to make calls to Scilab interpreter 
	from a Java program using JNI 
	(Java Native interface: 
		http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/jni/index.html)
	(Unix only since the proper Makefiles for windows 
	are not still writen) 
	
In this directory we provide a small example of a java class 
which use the Scilab interpreter to perform matrix computation 

This example was only tested under linux: 

	Red Hat 7.0 linux and 
	Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.3.0)
	Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.3.0, mixed mode). 
	Red Hat 7.1 linux and 
	Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.3.1)

To make it run you have to edit the Makefile 
and change the SCIDIR variable to fit your local Scilab installation 

You also have to edit the file config/Makefile.all 
and change in CFLAGS the include path associated to java 
(on my local installation it was 
 -I/usr/local/jdk1.3/include -I/usr/local/jdk1.3/include/linux ) 

If you intend to just build the librairie  libjavasci.so 
and use it from an other directory then take care to 
change the SCIDIR pathname in the Makefile to an absolute 
pathname. 

Then type 
	make distclean 
	javac JavaSciMatrix.java 
	make all 

	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH `pwd`
	java JavaSciMatrix 

That's all
