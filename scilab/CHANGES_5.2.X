               Changes between version 5.1.1 and 5.2.0-beta1 of Scilab
               =======================================================


Xcos:
=====

Xcos is developed simultaneously and together with Scilab, and replaces Scicos
in Scilab distributions. With a new ergonomic and efficient block diagrams 
editor, Xcos provides functionalities for modeling mechanical systems and control
systems, and is particularly suitable for industrial and academic needs.

This new version provides numerous new features:
* Several diagrams can be edited at the same time
* Scilab can be used during the diagram construction
* Diagram edition is available even during simulation
* Drap and drop from palettes to diagram and between diagrams
* History (Undo/Redo) with an unlimited number of actions memorized 
* Viewport to have an overall view of your diagram
* Palette window with new palettes organization
* Improved stability
* Better usability of menus
* Tool tips on block
* Big diagram managements
* Better integration of the demonstrations
* Standard shortcuts (Copy/Paste/Undo/Redo/...)

ATOMS:
======

ATOMS is the packaging system for Scilab's modules. Thanks to ATOMS, any user
running Scilab on a supported operating system is able to
install any modules from Scilab or third-party repositories with only three 
clicks or with just one Scilab command.

For example, the following command will install plotlib:
atomsInstall("plotlib")
This command will:
* download the binary package of plotlib from the Scilab repository
* unpack the package
* configure the package
* load the package

Many packages are already available and more are going to be offered
on Scilab's repositories.

This system is fully open to contributors. Anyone can manage his own toolbox
on Scilab ATOMS website (http://atoms.scilab.org) or run his own 
repository.

Note that ATOMS website replaces the current toolboxes/modules web interface.


Text Editor:
============

A new text editor is implemented in this version of Scilab. The editor now
follows the look and feel of Scilab and is integrated into the docking system.

The following features are available:
* Syntaxic colorization
* Automatic indentation
* Line numbering
* Execute into Scilab
* Comment/uncomment of blocks
* Go to line

Graphics:
=========

* Text rendering with LaTeX / MathML

The annotation of Scilab's graphics in MathML or LaTeX is now possible. 
It enables the integration of mathematical equations, greek variables, matrix 
displays... 
This is available in any cases where text can be set in the graphic (label, 
tick, title, xstring...).
For example:
x = 1:0.25:10;y1 = 1 + sin(4*%pi*x / 10);plot(x,y1,'k-');
xstring(6,1.4,'$\leftarrow f \left( x \right) = 1 + \sin \left( \frac{x \cdot 4 \cdot \pi}{10} \right)$');
See demos => Graphics => LaTeX/MathML
Thanks to Calixte Denizet for this feature and the underlying API for LaTeX rendering (project JLaTeXMath)

* New features
  - Antialiasing on graphics
    This new feature improves the quality of graphic rendering.
    It can be activated with the following commands: 
    df = gdf(); df.anti_aliasing = "8x"; plot3d();
    The rationnal and performance tests are available in SEP #16 or can be
    requested in Scilab bugtracker as bug #2984.
  - Add transparency to markdrawing.

* 'xbasc' is obsolete. See 'clf'

Introduction of new binaries:
=============================

The goal of these changes is to improve the capabilities to use Scilab
in different environnements and use cases.

* Scilab 5.2 introduces new binaries in the distribution:

  - classical - The GUI application (equivalent to Scilab Standard Mode).
    This program is exactly the same as in the previous version and all arguments
    are still available
    Name: scilab

  - Advanced Command-Line Interpreter (ACLI) - Interpreter in command line with the graphic capabilities available 
    (equivalent to Scilab NW Mode)
    Name: scilab-adv-cli

  - Command-Line Interpreter (CLI) - Interpreter in command line without the graphic or Tcl/Tk capabilities (faster)
    (equivalent to Scilab NWNI Mode)
    Name: scilab-cli

  See SEP #18 for more details

* The pipe has been plugged back under all operating systems
    It is now possible to do:
    echo "disp(%pi)"|./bin/scilab-adv-cli
    echo "disp(%pi)"|./bin/scilab-cli
    echo "disp(%pi)"|./bin/scilab -nw
    echo "disp(%pi)"|./bin/scilab -nwni

* Add error code capability to exit (SEP #19 and request 505).
  Example:
  echo "if 1<>2 then exit(99) end"|scilab -nwni; echo $?
  returns 99


Optimization:
=============
* New features
 - Created neldermead component for simplex-based direct search optimization
 - Created nmplot component for fast plots of neldermead optimization
 - Created optimbase component to build optimization algorithms
 - Created optimsimplex component to build direct search algorithms
 - Created fminsearch optimization function
 - Created optimget/optimset to configure fminsearch
 - Created optimplotfunccount, optimplotfval, optimplotx as plotting functions for fminsearch
* Improvements
 - Added examples in the help of optim for logging feature and optimization
   based on numerical derivatives


Extension capabilities of Scilab (API Scilab):
==============================================

In the previous versions of Scilab, there was no clear or easy way to extend
Scilab or to use it as an embedded application. 
Knowing these drawbacks, Scilab 5.2 tackles all those issues by prodiving a new
consistent, documented and easy way to use API. 

* A new API called api_scilab is available. This API provides functions to
  read/write data from/to Scilab memory.
  It provides many advantages:
  - management of all Scilab data types
  - consistency over all data types
  - error management
  - fully documented
  - fully tested by unitary tests
  - and it will be maintained over future versions of Scilab

  Note that all other Scilab API (straight access to the Scilab stack, stack1,
  stack2 and stack3) will be maintained in the Scilab 5.X family but most of
  them will be dropped in the 6 family.
  Do not hesitate to submit a bug report if you would like to see new features
  and functions in Scilab API.

* In the enum sci_types which lists all Scilab data types, the type 
  "sci_lufact_pointer" has been renamed "sci_pointer".
  A define of "sci_lufact_pointer" on "sci_pointer" has been added to backward
  compatibilities.
  The rationale is to improve the use in special case of the pointer data type
  to avoid memory duplication.

* Under all operating systems but Windows, all headers are not installed in a single directory 
  in order to simplify the use   of Scilab features in the dynamic link.
  See SEP #32 for more information

* From this version of Scilab, only a defined and documented number of headers
  are installed. 
  Thanks to this change, a module/toolbox developer knows exactly what are the
  available functions provided by Scilab.
  See SEP #35. 
  Do not hesitate to contact us if you have been using a Scilab header which has been removed from Scilab 5.2.


call_scilab module:
===================

Call Scilab is the API which allows Scilab to be called as computing engine or
embedded into a third-party application.
From this version, Call Scilab is based on Scilab API and handles all Scilab
data types (in previous versions, Double, Boolean, Complex Matrixes and String 
elements were managed).
The Call Scilab function has the same profile as Scilab API with 'Named' into 
the function name.
 
* CallScilab.h renamed call_scilab.h (See SEP #34). CallScilab.h is still 
  available and points to call_scilab.h

* Documentation and examples about call_scilab added (BooleanManagement call_scilab
  compile_and_run_call_scilab DisableInteractiveMode GetLastJob DoubleManagement
  ScilabHaveAGraph SendScilabJobs SendScilabJob StartScilab StringManagement
  TerminateScilab)

* Some function profiles in stack3.h provided to manage named variable
  have been moved in CallScilab.h (please note that we have not changed the ABI
  and the symbols remain in the core library)
  The goal of this modification is to separate functions dealing with the
  call_scilab API and the internal API used in the gateways.
  Note that all moved functions are considered as obsolete.

* In call_scilab, all previous functions available to read/write data from/to
  the Scilab engine are now obsolete but supported until Scilab 6:

  * C2F(readmat) is obsolete. Please use readNamedMatrix in api_double.h
  * C2F(readchain) is obsolete. Please use readNamedMatrixOfString or readNamedMatrixOfWideString in api_string.h
  * C2F(matptr) is obsolete. Please use readNamedMatrixOfDouble in api_double.h
  * C2F(creadmat) is obsolete. Please use readNamedMatrix in api_double.h
  * C2F(creadbmat) is obsolete. Please use readNamedMatrixOfBoolean in api_boolean.h
  * C2F(creadcmat) is obsolete. Please use readNamedComplexMatrixOfDouble in api_double.h
  * C2F(creadchain) is obsolete. Please use readNamedMatrixOfString or readNamedMatrixOfWideString in api_string.h
  * C2F(creadchains) is obsolete. Please use readNamedMatrixOfString or readNamedMatrixOfWideString in api_string.h in api_string.h
  * C2F(cmatptr) is obsolete. Please use readNamedMatrixOfDouble in api_double.h
  * C2F(cmatcptr) is obsolete. Please use readNamedComplexMatrixOfDouble in api_double.h
  * C2F(cmatsptr) is obsolete. Please use createNamedMatrixOfString or createNamedMatrixOfWideString in api_string.h
  * C2F(cmatbptr) is obsolete. Please use createNamedMatrixOfBoolean in api_boolean.h
  * C2F(cwritemat) is obsolete. Please use createNamedMatrixOfDouble in api_double.h
  * C2F(cwritecmat) is obsolete. Please use createNamedComplexMatrixOfDouble in api_double.h
  * C2F(cwritechain) is obsolete. Please use createNamedMatrixOfString or createNamedMatrixOfWideString in api_string.h
  * C2F(cwritebmat) is obsolete. Please use createNamedMatrixOfBoolean in api_boolean.h

* "make check" now also builds call_scilab examples

* An example to call Scilab from C# added.
   see SCI/modules/call_scilab/examples/call_scilab/NET/C# directory

* libtool updated from version 1.5.26 to 2.2.7a (Closes bug #4279) with some
  patches for Mac OS X/Darwin support

* --enable-debug-java add two options to the JVM args (-verbose:jni and
  -Xcheck:jni) in order to provide more feedbacks on debug
  Note that this should not be used into a binary since it is expensive

* C++ => Java connector updated (using GIWS - 
  http://www.scilab.org/giws/ version 1.0.5)
  There was a bug in GIWS:
  The use of a static method returning an int was not calling the right
  method.
  It did not seem to trigger any errors in the past but the latest 
  version of the JDK is now complaining.


* Patches applied (see bugs #4506, #4517 & #4588) by Dan McMahill. They fix 
  some compile time problems under NetBSD which also improve all operating systems but Windows.
    - adds some missing $host to the 64 bit list.  
    - adds a needed compiler flag for alpha-*-netbsd
    - adds autoconf check for term.h header
    - adds autoconf checks for gettext
    - adds autoconf check for dlopen in -ldl 
      (on some systems, we do not need -ldl because dlopen is in libc).  
      Do not hardcode linking with -ldl but rely on this new check.
    - adds correct getrlimit() argument for NetBSD and DragonFly
    - avoids pulling in an OSF1 specific header on NetBSD/alpha
    - adds missing newline at the end of a file
    - adds missing XML LIBS and CFLAGS
    - adds LTLIBINTL to the list of common objects needed for linking the top level binary.
    - adds checks for term.h and termcap.h headers.  
    - adds check for -lpthread
    - reworks the checks for curses a little bit to search for 
      curses.h and -lcurses first followed by ncurses.h and -lncurses.   
    - uses configure results to protect the inclusion of curses.h, 
      ncurses.h, term.h, and termcap.h.
    - adds __DragonFly__ to a few conditional lines.
    - removes the static declaration of BC to match what was found
      in a header file.
    - adds missing enable_keypad_mode()
    - uses configure results to protect the inclusion of curses.h, 
      ncurses.h, term.h, and termcap.h.
    - Large amounts of cleanup of the PVM configure code (Closes: #4151)

* Improve detection of build/run environment under GNU/Linux Debian under
  arm, armel, mips & mipsel

======

* test_run() now accepts Sub-Modules (See SEP #31)

Internationalization and Characters Encoding:
=============================================

* Italian localization added (Thanks Carmelo Leggio)

* More help pages translated to Portugues do Brazil (Thanks Daniel de Souza Grilo)

* Catalan localization added to Scipad (Thanks Oriol Gonzalez)

* Characters encoding:

  Strings manipulations functions updated to use wide characters.
  This feature add ability to manipulate any language on any system regardless of the system code page.

  Internal C functions added: readNamedMatrixOfWideString, createNamedMatrixOfWideString,
                              getMatrixOfWideString, createMatrixOfWideString in api_string.h
                              to manage wide characters with scilab API.

  input/output files functions also updated to use wide characters.
  Default file format encoding used by Scilab is UTF-8.

Bugs:

                   Scilab were not handling correctly for the Japanese and
                   others languages. This was happenning with m2sci and the
                   demos browser.

* bug 5071 fixed - isletter("√©") returned [%F %F] instead of %F.
