Since pluging a menus does not work correctly with gtk2. 
This version works in a different way zterm creates a zterm widget and
forks a child program. The child program must create a socket widget
and sends to its parent process the id of the socket using shared
memory. When the parent process get the socket id the zterm widget 
is plugged to this socket widget via a gtk plug.
