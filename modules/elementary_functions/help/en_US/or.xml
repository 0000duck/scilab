  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P><VERB>or(A)</VERB>  gives the  <VERB>or</VERB> of the elements of the  boolean 
    matrix  <VERB>A</VERB>. <VERB>or(A)</VERB> is true (<VERB>%t</VERB>) iff at least one entry of
    <VERB>A</VERB> is <VERB>%t</VERB>.</P>
    <P><VERB>y=or(A,'r')</VERB> (or, equivalently, <VERB>y=or(A,1)</VERB>) is the rowwise or. It returns in each 
    entry of the row vector <VERB>y</VERB> the or of the rows of <VERB>x</VERB> (The or is performed on the 
    row index : <VERB>y(j)= or(A(i,j),i=1,m)</VERB>).</P>
    <P><VERB>y=or(A,'c')</VERB> (or, equivalently, <VERB>y=or(A,2)</VERB>) is the columnwise or. It returns 
    in each entry of the column vector <VERB>y</VERB> the or of the columns of <VERB>x</VERB> 
    (The or is performed on the column index:  <VERB>y(i)= or(A(i,j),j=1,n)</VERB>)).</P>
    <P><VERB>A|B</VERB>  gives the element-wise logical <VERB>or</VERB> of the booleans matrices
     <VERB>A</VERB> and  <VERB>B</VERB> .<VERB>A</VERB> and  <VERB>B</VERB> must be matrices with the same
     dimensions or one from them must be a single boolean.</P>
