\chapter{Validation}

In this section, we present the validation of the Nelder-Mead 
toolbox by comparison with published results of the Nelder-Mead 
method. The algorithms are extensively presented and 
associated with numerical experiments in the appendix.
This is why we present in this part only the Scilab scripts and 
Scilab results, so that a user can check by himself that the
computed results correspond to the expected ones.
