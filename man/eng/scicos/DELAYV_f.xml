  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="DELAYV_f"> Scicos time varying delay block  </SHORT_DESCRIPTION>
  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
    This block implements a time varying discretized delay. The value of
    the delay is given by the second input port. The delayed signal enters
    the first input port and leaves the unique output prot. 
  </P>
    <P>
    The first event output port must be connected to unique input event port if
    auto clocking is desired. But the input event port can also be driven
    by outside clock. In that case, the max delay is size of initial
    condition times the period of the incoming clock.
  </P>
    <P>
    The second output event port generates an event if the second input
    goes above the maximum delay specified. This signal can be ignored. In
    that case the output will be delayed by max delay.
  </P>
