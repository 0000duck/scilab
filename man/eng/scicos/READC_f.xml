  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="READC_f"> Scicos &quot;read from C binary file&quot; block   </SHORT_DESCRIPTION>
  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
    This block allows user to read datas in a C file.  <VERB>Output record
    selection</VERB> and <VERB>Time record Selection</VERB> allows the user to select
    data among file records.
  </P>
    <P>
    Each call to the block advance one record in the file. 
  </P>

      <ITEM label="Time record Selection">
        <SP>: an empty matrix or a positive integer. If an integer <VERB>i</VERB> is given the  <VERB>i</VERB>th element of the read record is assumed to be the date of the output event. If empty no output event exists.</SP>
      </ITEM>
      <ITEM label="Output record selection">
        <SP>: a vector of positive integer. <VERB>[k1,..,kn]</VERB>,The <VERB>ki</VERB>th element of  the read record gives the value of <VERB>i</VERB>th output.</SP>

        <SP>: a character string defining the path of the file</SP>

        <SP>: for reading  respectively  long, ashort, unsigned long,  unsigned short, double,  float,  char and  unsigned char. If required by the <VERB>swap mode</VERB>, the bytes which are read are automatically swapped if necessary (by checking little-endian status) in order to produce machine independent binary files ( in little-endian mode).</SP>
      </ITEM>
      <ITEM label="&quot;ull&quot;,&quot;uls&quot;,&quot;ubl&quot;,&quot;ubs&quot;,">
        <SP>: can be used for reading respectively unsigned little-endian long or short and unsigned big-endian long or short.</SP>

        <SP>: with <VERB>x=b</VERB> or <VERB>x=l</VERB> can be used for reading double, float, long or short as big or little endian.</SP>

      <ITEM label="Record size">
        <SP>: The file is supposed to be formed by a sequence  of data with same format. these data are organized in a sequence of record each of them containing <VERB>Record size</VERB> data.</SP>
      </ITEM>
      <ITEM label="Buffer size">
        <SP>: To improve efficiency it is possible to buffer the input data. read on the file is only done after each <VERB>Buffer size</VERB> call to the block.</SP>
      </ITEM>
      <ITEM label="Initial record index">
        <SP>: a scalar. This fixes the first record of the file to use.</SP>
      </ITEM>
      <ITEM label="Swap mode">
        <SP>: With <VERB>Swap mode=</VERB>  the file is supposed to be coded in &quot;little endian IEEE format&quot; and data are swaped if necessary to match the IEEE format of the processor. If <VERB>Swap mode=</VERB>  then automatic bytes swap is disabled.</SP>
