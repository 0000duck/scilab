  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
To compute (optionally) a rank-revealing QR factorization of a real
general M-by-N real or complex matrix <VERB/>, which may be
rank-deficient, and estimate its effective rank using incremental
condition estimation.</P>
    <P>
The routine uses a QR factorization with column pivoting:</P>
    <VERBATIM>
<![CDATA[
        A * P = Q * R,  where  R = [ R11 R12 ],
                                   [  0  R22 ]
]]>
    </VERBATIM>
    <P>
with <VERB>R1</VERB> defined as the largest leading submatrix whose
estimated condition number is less than <VERB>1/RCON</VERB>.  The
order of <VERB>R1</VERB>, <VERB>RAN</VERB>, is the effective rank of
<VERB/>.</P>
    <P>
If the triangular factorization is a rank-revealing one (which will be
the case if the leading columns were well- conditioned), then
<VERB>SVAL(1)</VERB> will also be an estimate for the largest singular
value of <VERB/>, and <VERB>SVAL(2)</VERB> and
<VERB>SVAL(3)</VERB> will be estimates for the <VERB>RAN</VERB>-th
and <VERB>(RANK+1)</VERB>-st singular values of <VERB/>,
respectively.</P>
    <P>
By examining these values, one can confirm that the
rank is well defined with respect to the chosen value of
<VERB>RCON</VERB>.  The ratio <VERB>SVAL(1)/SVAL(2)</VERB> is an
estimate of the condition number of <VERB>R(1:RANK,1:RANK)</VERB>.</P>
