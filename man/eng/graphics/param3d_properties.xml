  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="param3d_properties"> description of the
   3D curves entities properties</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>
  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
  The Param3d entity is a leaf of the graphics entities
  hierarchy.  This entity is still under developpement
  and will problably evolve a lot. In particular we intend to extend
  the Axes data structure to 3D and split the Axes properties and
  Param3d drawing properties similarily to the 2D case.

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="visible: ">
        <SP>This field contains the  <VERB>visible</VERB> property value
   for the entity . It should
   be <VERB>&quot;on&quot; </VERB> or <VERB>&quot;off&quot;</VERB>  . By default, 
   the curves are visibles, the value's property is  <VERB>&quot;on&quot;
   </VERB>. If <VERB>&quot;off&quot;</VERB> the curves are not drawn on the screen.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="data: ">
        <SP>This field contains the coordinates of the 3d curves. it is the
    matrix <VERB>[X,Y,Z]</VERB> such as  <VERB>X(:,i)</VERB>,
    <VERB>Y(:,i)</VERB>, <VERB>Z(:,i)</VERB> contain the 3D
    coordinates of the <VERB>i</VERB>'th curve.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="data_bounds: ">
        <SP>This field contains the boundary values for the x, y and z
    coordinates. It is the matrix <VERB>[xmin,xmax;ymin,ymax;zmin,zmax]</VERB>.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="thickness: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default  <VERB>thickness</VERB> value 
       of the lines used to draw the axes and the curves. It should
       be a positive integer.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="foreground: ">
        <SP>This field contains the color index used to draw the axes and
       the curves.  Its value should be a color index (relative to
       the current colormap).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="rotation_angles: ">
        <SP>This field is the vector <VERB>[theta,alpha]</VERB>. These two
      values give  the spherical coordinates of the observation points (in degree).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="parent: ">
        <SP>This property contains the handle of the parent. The parent of the 3D curves
      entity should be of the type <VERB>&quot;Axes&quot;</VERB> .</SP>

  <EXAMPLE>
<![CDATA[   

   set("figure_style","new") //create a figure
   a=get("current_axes");//get the handle of the newly created axes
   t=[0:0.1:5*%pi]';

   a.rotation_angles=[65,75]; 
   a.data_bounds=[-1,-1,-1;1,1,2]; //boundaries given by data_bounds
   a.thickness = 2;
   h=a.children //get the handle of the param3d entity: an agregation composed of 2 curves
   h.children(1).foreground = 3 // first curve
   curve2 = h.children(2);
   curve2.foreground = 6;
   curve2.mark_style = 2;
