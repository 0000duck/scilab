  <DESCRIPTION>
  The figure entity is the top level of the graphics entities
  hierarchy. This entity defines the parameters for the figure itself
  as well as the  parameter's defaut values for the children creation


  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='Figure parameters: '>
  <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='figure_style: '>
     This field contains the figure style. The value of this field
      should be <VERB>"old"</VERB> or <VERB>"new"</VERB>.  The
      <VERB>"new"</VERB> value sets the entity based style. The
      <VERB>"old"</VERB> value sets the old Scilab graphic mode. In
      this case <VERB>figure_style</VERB> is the only defined property.
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='figure_position: '>
     This field contains the position in pixel of the  graphic
     window  on the screen. The size is the vector 
     <VERB>[x,y]</VERB>. The point <VERB>[0,0]</VERB> if the
     upper-left corner of the screen.
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='figure_size: '>
     This field contains the size in pixel of the screen's graphics
     window. The size is the vector <VERB>[width,height] </VERB>.
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    
     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='axes_size: '>
     This field contains the size in pixel of the virtual graphics
     window. The size is the vector <VERB>[width,height] </VERB>.
     The  virtual graphic window should be bigger than the part really
     visible on the screen.
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='auto_resize: '>
     This field  defines what happen when the graphics window
     is resized. If the value is <VERB>"on"</VERB> then the
     <VERB>axes_size</VERB> property is equaled to the
     <VERB>figure_size</VERB> and the axes children are zoomed
     accordingly. If the value is <VERB>"off"</VERB> then the
     <VERB>axes_size</VERB> does not change with <VERB>figure_size</VERB>.
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='figure_name: '>

     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='figure_id: '>
     This field contains the identifier of the figure. This  is a
     integer number. This number is set at figure creation and cannot
     be changed after that.
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='color_map: '>
     This field contains the colormap used by this figure. The
     colormap is a <VERB>m</VERB> by <VERB>3</VERB> matrix.
     <VERB>m</VERB> is the number of colors. Color number i is given
     as a 3-uple <VERB>R</VERB>, <VERB>G</VERB>, <VERB>B</VERB> corresponding
     respectively to red, green and blue intensity between 0 and 1
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='background: '>
     This field contains the index (relative to the current colormap) 
     of the figure's background color.
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

  
     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='pixel_drawing_mode: '>
     This fieds defines the bitwise operation used to draw the pixel
     on the screen. The default mode is <VERB>copy</VERB> what is to
     say the pixel is drawn as required. More generally the a bitwise
     operation is performed between the color of the source pixel and
     the color of the pixel already present on the screen. 
     operations are :    
    <VERB>"clear"</VERB>, 
    <VERB>"and"</VERB>, 
    <VERB>"andReverse"</VERB> , 
    <VERB>"copy"</VERB>,  src
