  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
  The figure entity is the top level of the graphics entities
  hierarchy. This entity contain a number of properties designed to control 
  many aspects of displaying Scilab graphics objects.
  These properties fall into two categories. Properties that contain information 
  about figure itself and others related to set default values for the children creation.

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="Figure properties: ">
        <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="figure_style: ">
            <SP>The value of this field difines the figure style, it
      should be <VERB>&quot;old&quot;</VERB> or <VERB>&quot;new&quot;</VERB>.  The
      <VERB>&quot;new&quot;</VERB> value sets the entity based style. The
      <VERB>&quot;old&quot;</VERB> value represents the old Scilab graphic mode. In
      this case <VERB>figure_style</VERB> is the only defined property.</SP>
          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="figure_position: ">
            <SP>This field contains the position in pixel of the  graphic
     window  on the screen. The size is the vector 
     <VERB>[x,y]</VERB>. The point <VERB>[0,0]</VERB> if the
     upper-left corner of the screen.</SP>
          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="figure_size: ">
            <SP>This property controls the size in pixel of the screen's graphics
     window. The size is the vector <VERB>[width,height] </VERB>.</SP>

     If the value is <VERB>&quot;on&quot;</VERB> then the <VERB>axes_size</VERB> 
     property is equaled to the <VERB>figure_size</VERB> and the axes 
     children are zoomed accordingly. If the value is <VERB>&quot;off&quot;</VERB> that indicate

     the color of the pixel already present on the screen. 
     operations are :   
    <VERB>&quot;clear&quot;</VERB>,
