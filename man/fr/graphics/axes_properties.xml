  <DESCRIPTION>
  The Axes entity is the second level of the graphics entities
  hierarchy. This entity defines the parameters for the change of
  coordinates and the axes drawing
  as well as the  parameter's defaut values for the children creation.

  <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
  
     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='visible: '>
      This field contains the  <VERB>visible</VERB> property value
     for axes . It's value should
     be <VERB>"on" </VERB> or <VERB>"off"</VERB>  . If <VERB>"on"
     </VERB> the axes and all "visible" chidren are drawn, If
     <VERB>"off"</VERB> the axes and all it's chidren are not drawn.
