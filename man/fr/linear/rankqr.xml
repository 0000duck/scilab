  <PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
    : real number used to determine the effective rank of

  triangular submatrix <VERB>R11</VERB> in the QR factorization with

  <PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
    : integer vector on entry, if <VERB>JPVT(i)</VERB> is not 0, the

 of <VERB>AP</VERB>, otherwise column <VERB>i</VERB> is a free
 column. On exit, if <VERB>JPVT(i) = k</VERB>, then the

  <DESCRIPTION>
To compute (optionally) a rank-revealing QR factorization of a real
general M-by-N real or complex matrix <VERB>A</VERB>, which may be
rank-deficient, and estimate its effective rank using incremental
condition estimation.
<P>
</P>
The routine uses a QR factorization with column pivoting:
<VERBATIM><![CDATA[
        A * P = Q * R,  where  R = [ R11 R12 ],
                                   [  0  R22 ]
]]></VERBATIM>
with <VERB>R11</VERB> defined as the largest leading submatrix whose
estimated condition number is less than <VERB>1/RCOND</VERB>.  The
order of <VERB>R11</VERB>, <VERB>RANK</VERB>, is the effective rank of
<VERB>A</VERB>.
<P>
</P>
If the triangular factorization is a rank-revealing one (which will be
the case if the leading columns were well- conditioned), then
<VERB>SVAL(1)</VERB> will also be an estimate for the largest singular
value of <VERB>A</VERB>, and <VERB>SVAL(2)</VERB> and
<VERB>SVAL(3)</VERB> will be estimates for the <VERB>RANK</VERB>-th
and <VERB>(RANK+1)</VERB>-st singular values of <VERB>A</VERB>,
respectively. 
 <P>
</P>
By examining these values, one can confirm that the
rank is well defined with respect to the chosen value of
<VERB>RCOND</VERB>.  The ratio <VERB>SVAL(1)/SVAL(2)</VERB> is an
estimate of the condition number of <VERB>R(1:RANK,1:RANK)</VERB>.
