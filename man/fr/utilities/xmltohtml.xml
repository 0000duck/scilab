  <DESCRIPTION>
<P>
converts xml Scilab help files contained in a set of directories  into
html files. 
</P>
In a first step ("whatis") a whatis.htm file is generated in each directory using
information given in the "SHORT_DESCRIPTION" tag of each xml file and
the given title.
<P>
</P>
<P>
In a second step ("index") the tags LINK are analysed, and xmltohtml tries to
resolve  the references using the already known help files defined in
the <VERB>%helps</VERB> variable.
</P>
<P>
The third step ("html") it translates the xml file to html using external program
xsltproc and the given  xsl file which should be located in
<VERB>SCIDIR/man/LANGUAGE/</VERB>
The generated html files are located together with the
corresponding xml ones.
</P>
<P>
the last step ("contents") produces a contents.xml file
</P>
<P>
if dirs is  [] then already defined help directories
(see <VERB>%helps(:,1)</VERB>)  are assumed and titles are searched in <VERB>%helps(:,2)</VERB>. So
<VERB>xmltohtml([])</VERB> updates currents html files
